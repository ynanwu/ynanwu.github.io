<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Lecturer in the Department of Artificial Intelligence, College of Information and Electrical Engineering at [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/). From March 2024 to March 2025, I am serving as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/), Canada. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn) in March 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Songhe Feng](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8407/). Prior to my graduation, I was a Visiting Scholar at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca), Canada (Jan. 2023 – Jan. 2024), supervised by Prof. [Yang Wang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~wayang/). I am interested in the general areas of **computer vision** and **machine learning**, with research focuses on **transfer learning**, **meta-learning** and **incremental learning**. I have also built AI models beyond the "brute-force" supervised approach. The ultimate goal is to allow the AI models to be **personalized**, **flexible**, and **easily adaptable** to different scenarios with minimal efforts.
