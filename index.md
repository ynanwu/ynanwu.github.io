<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Prof. [Songhe Feng](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8407/). At present, I am being funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to serve as a visiting scholar at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca) in Canada, under the guidance of Prof. [Yang Wang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~wayang/). I am interested in the general areas of **computer vision** and **machine learning**, with research focuses on **transfer learning**, **meta-learning** and **incremental learning**. I have also built AI models beyond the "brute-force" supervised approach. The ultimate goal is to allow the AI models to be **personalized**, **flexible**, and **easily adaptable** to different scenarios with minimal efforts.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
